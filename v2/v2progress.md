# V2 Mediflux Progress Tracker

## [2025-08-02] Phase 1: Initial V2 Structure & Module Migration

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. V2 Folder Structure Creation
- ✅ Created `/v2/` directory with modular architecture
- ✅ Set up module directories: orchestrator, interpreter, reimbursement, document_analyzer, care_pathway, data_hub, memory
- ✅ Created data directory structure: `/v2/data/cache/`
- ✅ Established frontend placeholder directory

#### 2. Core Module Development

**Orchestrator Module**
- ✅ Created `orchestrator.py` - main V2 orchestrator with intent-based routing
- ✅ Implemented user context management and module coordination
- ✅ Added support for all major intents: cost simulation, document analysis, care pathway, medication info, practitioner search

**Intent Router** 
- ✅ Created `interpreter/intent_router.py` - rule-based intent matching
- ✅ Implemented pattern matching for 5 core intents
- ✅ Added entity extraction (location, medication, specialty, etc.)
- ✅ Prepared fallback to local AI (Mixtral) for complex queries

**Memory Store**
- ✅ Created `memory/store.py` - SQLite-based user profile and session management
- ✅ Implemented user context storage with automatic compression
- ✅ Added GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion)
- ✅ Built session history tracking with privacy controls

**Data Hub Clients**
- ✅ Created `data_hub/bdpm.py` - refactored BDPM GraphQL client from V1
- ✅ Added medication search by name, substance, and CIS code
- ✅ Implemented reimbursement calculation and generic search features
- ✅ Created `data_hub/annuaire.py` - Annuaire Santé FHIR client with aggregation focus
- ✅ Created `data_hub/odisse.py` - Odissé API client for regional healthcare metrics
- ✅ Created `data_hub/open_medic.py` - CSV processor for medication reimbursement trends

**Reimbursement Simulator**
- ✅ Created `reimbursement/simulator.py` - cost breakdown calculator
- ✅ Implemented Sécurité Sociale and mutuelle coverage simulation
- ✅ Added consultation and medication cost estimation
- ✅ Built mutuelle comparison and savings tip generation

**Document Analyzer**
- ✅ Created `document_analyzer/handler.py` - OCR and rule-based extraction
- ✅ Implemented support for carte tiers payant, feuille de soins, prescriptions
- ✅ Built pattern matching for healthcare document types
- ✅ Prepared Tesseract OCR integration (TODO: implement)

**Care Pathway Advisor**
- ✅ Created `care_pathway/advisor.py` - intelligent care sequence recommendations
- ✅ Implemented pathway templates for common conditions
- ✅ Added cost estimation and timeline calculation
- ✅ Built optimization tips based on user preferences

#### 3. Migration from V1
- ✅ Preserved valuable V1 components: BDPM integration, Annuaire Santé logic
- ✅ Refactored medication toolkit into modular BDPM client
- ✅ Adapted smart orchestrator concepts into new intent-based architecture
- ✅ Maintained API compatibility for external data sources

#### 4. Project Infrastructure
- ✅ Created V2 requirements.txt with updated dependencies
- ✅ Set up module __init__.py files for proper imports
- ✅ Created test_v2.py for module verification
- ✅ Moved V2 planning files to v2/ directory

### 🔍 Current Status
- **Architecture**: ✅ Complete modular structure established
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ All main modules implemented with async support
- **Data Integration**: ✅ BDPM, Annuaire, Odissé, OpenMedic clients ready
- **User Management**: ✅ Memory store with privacy controls
- **Cost Simulation**: ✅ Reimbursement calculator with mutuelle support

### 📋 Next Steps (Week 1 Remaining)
- 🔧 Test V2 module integration and fix import issues
- 🔧 Create simple CLI or web interface for testing
- 🔧 Implement actual OCR integration (Tesseract)
- 🔧 Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- 🔧 Create example usage scripts and documentation

### 📊 Progress Summary
- **Week 1 Goal**: Clean up repo, establish new folder/module structure, migrate orchestrator & interpreter
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All core modules implemented and ready for testing

## Preserved V1 Components
- BDPM GraphQL API integration → Refactored into `data_hub/bdpm.py`
- Annuaire Santé FHIR API logic → Refactored into `data_hub/annuaire.py`
- Smart orchestrator concepts → Evolved into `orchestrator.py` with intent routing
- AI query interpretation patterns → Integrated into `interpreter/intent_router.py`

## Removed V1 Components
- XAI/Grok AI dependencies → Replaced with rule-based + local AI fallback
- Hardcoded test scripts → Replaced with modular test framework
- Monolithic structure → Replaced with modular architecture
- Complex UI dependencies → Simplified to focus on core functionality

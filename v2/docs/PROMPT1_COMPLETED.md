# V2 Prompt 1 - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully completed Prompt 1 from v2prompts.md with all core requirements met.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### ✅ Test all migrated V1 components
- **BDPM GraphQL**: Migrated to `data_hub/bdpm.py` *(API connectivity issue documented in v2issues.md)*
- **Annuaire Santé FHIR**: Migrated to `data_hub/annuaire.py` and functional
- **Memory Store**: Migrated to `memory/store.py` and fully operational
- **Intent Router**: Migrated to `interpreter/intent_router.py` and working

### ✅ Ensure refactored code functions correctly
- All modules import without errors
- Core functionality validated through focused testing
- Data flow between components working properly

### ✅ Remove local LLM implementations and maintain XAI API usage
- Intent router uses rule-based patterns with XAI API fallback (V1 approach maintained)
- No local LLM dependencies in V2 architecture
- XAI integration preserved from V1 system

### ✅ Fix all import errors
- Module path issues resolved
- All V1 migrated components importable
- Clean module structure implemented

### ✅ Create basic test script
- `test_focused_prompt1.py`: Streamlined functionality test
- `test_prompt1.py`: Comprehensive test with detailed logging
- Both validate core component migration and integration

## Architecture Status
- **V2 Modular Design**: ✅ Complete
- **Intent-Based Routing**: ✅ Functional  
- **Memory Management**: ✅ Working
- **Data Hub Integration**: ✅ Ready (external API issue noted)
- **Orchestration Layer**: ✅ Operational

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to **Prompt 2**: Database Architecture Implementation

## Known Issues
See `v2issues.md` for BDPM API connectivity issue (external service dependency)

# Mediflux Knowledge Base Expansion Roadmap

## âœ… COMPLETED (Week 1)
- [x] Knowledge base architecture design
- [x] Infection urinaire complete pathway (pilot)
- [x] Integration with BDPM medication data
- [x] Evidence-based response generation
- [x] Source attribution and confidence scoring

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY PATHOLOGIES (Week 2-3)
Add structured knowledge for top 10 conditions:

### 1. Mal de dos (Back pain)
- **Sources**: HAS guidelines, WHO recommendations
- **Integration**: Physiotherapy costs, specialist wait times
- **Complexity**: High (multiple pathways: acute vs chronic)

### 2. DiabÃ¨te type 2 (Type 2 diabetes)
- **Sources**: SFD guidelines, ADA recommendations
- **Integration**: Medication monitoring, lab costs
- **Complexity**: High (ongoing management)

### 3. Hypertension
- **Sources**: ESC guidelines, French cardiology society
- **Integration**: Medication titration, monitoring costs
- **Complexity**: Medium (standardized protocols)

### 4. DÃ©pression (Depression)
- **Sources**: HAS recommendations, psychiatric guidelines
- **Integration**: Therapy costs, medication options
- **Complexity**: High (personalized approaches)

### 5. Migraine
- **Sources**: IHS criteria, French headache society
- **Integration**: Preventive vs acute treatments
- **Complexity**: Medium (clear protocols)

## ðŸ”„ DATA INTEGRATION PRIORITIES

### Real-Time Data Sources
1. **DREES Regional Data**: Specialist density, wait times
2. **SAE Hospital Data**: ER wait times, bed availability
3. **Open Medic**: Regional prescription patterns
4. **Assurance Maladie**: Latest reimbursement rates

### Clinical Guidelines Integration
1. **HAS (Haute AutoritÃ© de SantÃ©)**: Official French guidelines
2. **Medical Societies**: Specialty-specific recommendations
3. **International Guidelines**: WHO, ESC, ADA for global best practices
4. **Regional Protocols**: Local hospital and clinic standards

## ðŸ“ˆ QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MECHANISMS

### User Feedback Integration
